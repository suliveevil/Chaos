[h-node.org](https://h-node.org/): The **h-node** project aims at the construction of a hardware database in order to identify what devices work with a [fully free operating system](http://www.gnu.org/distros/free-distros.html). The h-node.org website is structured like a wiki in which all the users can modify or insert new contents. The h-node project is developed in collaboration and as an activity of the [FSF](http://www.fsf.org/).
