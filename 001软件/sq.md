[neilotoole/sq](https://github.com/neilotoole/sq): swiss-army knife for data

`sq` is a command line tool that provides `jq`-style access to structured data sources such as SQL databases, or document formats like CSV or Excel.

`sq` can perform cross-source joins, execute database-native SQL, and output to a multitude of formats including JSON, Excel, CSV, HTML, Markdown and XML, or insert directly to a SQL database. `sq` can also inspect sources to view metadata about the source structure (tables, columns, size) and has commands for common database operations such as copying or dropping tables.
