[davidfraser/pyan](https://github.com/davidfraser/pyan): pyan is a Python module that performs static analysis of Python code to determine a call dependency graph between functions and methods. This is different from running the code and seeing which functions are called and how often; there are various tools that will generate a call graph in that way, usually using debugger or profiling trace hooks - for example: https://pycallgraph.readthedocs.org/ This code was originally written by Edmund Horner, and then modified by Juha Jeronen. See README for the original blog posts and links to their repositories.
