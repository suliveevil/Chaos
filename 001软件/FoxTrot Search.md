The premier document search and categorization solution for macOS

Whether working on a single project involving several documents or capitalizing on decades of produced and archived material, Foxtrot Professional Search is your key to gaining time, efficiency and precision in leveraging your documents.  
  
Foxtrot Professional Search hits the mark in three steps:

-   Use document-level secondary search with identical or distinct terms to locate them in context

  
FoxTrot Professional Search is extensible:

-   into your pocket or tablet with the Foxtrot Attaché Search for iOS companion app
-   to additional computers nearby with a five-user license upgrade
-   across NAS- or VPN- connected Macs in a workgroup or enterprise using Foxtrot Search Server, a full client-server solution included in 10-user licenses and greater
