## issues 问题

### closed 已处理

#### 弹出菜单 popup menu

别人家没毛病，到你这儿就跟系统冲突了，行行行，你nb，我把 FKA 关了行了吧！

> Full Keyboard Access is not supported in iThoughts (and there are no plans to add support.)
> 
> The app is simply not designed to be controlled entirely by the keyboard. Having Full Keyboard Access enabled breaks many aspects of the app - not only the popup menu.
