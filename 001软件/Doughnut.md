[dyerc/Doughnut](https://github.com/dyerc/Doughnut): [[播客]] client (podcatcher) for macOS

Previously Doughnut was built on top of [[Electron]] which worked ok, but using 200+ MB for a podcast app, even when it's minimized felt very poor. Doughnut is now written as a 100% native macOS app in [[Swift]].
